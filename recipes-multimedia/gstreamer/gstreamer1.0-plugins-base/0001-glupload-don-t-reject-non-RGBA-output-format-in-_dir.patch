Subject: [PATCH] glupload: don't reject non-RGBA output format in
 _directviv_upload_accept

In case of a more advanced sink that can support RGBA but also different YUV
formats, the initial output format for the glupload element might not be RGBA.
In that case, rejecting inside the upload method for the DirectVIV uploader
means picking a different uploader that won't do the job properly.

If the rejecetion is removed, the upload proceeds and the pipeline is later
reconfigured so that the DirectVIV uploader's RGBA-only output is respected,
meaning the final sink will also move over from handling I420 to RGBA.
